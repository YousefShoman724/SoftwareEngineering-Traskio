Project Name: Traskio Task Manager

Description:
Traskio is a web-based task management application that allows users to sign up, log in, and manage their tasks through a personal dashboard. Users can create, edit, delete, assign, and view tasks in a simple and user-friendly interface. The system uses session-based authentication to protect user data and restrict access to authorized users only.

Actors:
- Guest: A user who is not logged in.
- User: A registered and logged-in user.

Functional Requirements:
FR-01: The system shall allow a guest to sign up using an email and password.
FR-02: The system shall validate that the password and confirmation password match during signup.
FR-03: The system shall prevent registration using an already existing email.
FR-04: The system shall allow a registered user to log in with valid credentials.
FR-05: The system shall reject login attempts with invalid credentials.
FR-06: The system shall allow a logged-in user to access a protected dashboard.
FR-07: The system shall allow a user to create a new task.
FR-08: The system shall allow a user to edit an existing task.
FR-09: The system shall allow a user to delete a task.
FR-10: The system shall allow a user to assign a task to a user by email.
FR-11: The system shall allow a user to view a list of their assigned tasks.
FR-12: The system shall allow a logged-in user to log out and clear the session.

Non-Functional Requirements:
NFR-01: The application shall be web-based and accessible through a browser.
NFR-02: User passwords shall be stored securely using hashing.
NFR-03: The system shall provide fast response time for user actions.
NFR-04: The user interface shall be simple, clear, and user-friendly.
NFR-05: The system shall restrict access to protected pages unless the user is authenticated.

Data Storage:
- User data (email and hashed password) shall be stored in a file named "users.json".
- Task data (task id, title, description, status, assigned user) shall be stored in a file named "tasks.json".

Assumptions and Constraints:
- The application uses Flask as the backend framework.
- Data is stored locally using JSON files.
- The application is intended for educational purposes.
